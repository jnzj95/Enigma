 <h2> What am I looking at?
</h2>
<p>
Enigma was developed by myself (<a href="https://github.com/jnzj95">Jack Ng</a>) together with a friend (<a href="https://github.com/Ivan-LZY">Ivan Lim</a>), for a dance piece that I choreographed. The objective for developing this software was to have accompanying visual effects to highlight/obscure certain elements of the dancers' movements, and to offer the audience the option of looking at the same movement from a different perspective.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to share the code publically to allow anyone who is interested an opportunity to have the program for their own use. Maybe you saw the show and thought of ideas of your own on how to best use the features shown, want to build on an existing idea we presented, or simply want to improvise and explore different possibilities with the programme. I do get those bursts of inspiration watching such performances, so I thought it would be fun to let anyone interested play with this.
</p>
<p>(Do reach out if you come up with smth cool! I'm most active on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jkouutktoawski/">Instagram</a>, and I'd love to see anything built on this :D)</p>
<h2> States
</h2>
<p>
The section below describes each of the different features in the program, defined by states. You can change which state you are in using the number keys (NOT the keypad)
</p>

 <li>State 1: AM</li>
  <p>(Description of vanilla AM, fixed time interval)</p>
 <li>State 2: AM_On_Click</li>

<h2> A word of thanks
</h2>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who made this possible, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>My lovely collaborators and dancers, Ivan, Jun Hui, Pei Yao, Say Hua, Zeng Yu, and Chao Jing. Whether its coming up with code improvements without prompt, practicing the movement during your rest times, or asking for more practices, everyone has put in far more effort than I can reasonably expect, all of which I am deeply grateful for. Having people who were committed made a world of difference to me, and I consider myself extremely lucky to have had this chance to work with you all.</li>
<li>My endlessly encouraging mentor, Anthea, whose input helped give direction to the work. Having someone who believed in the work long before it was presentable was incredibly motivating.</li>
<li>Aik Song and Mus for their early contributions to the work. I hope to work with you both at some point in the future.</li>
<li>Sigma Contemporary Dance for providing the platform.</li>
<li>And lastly, thank you for taking the time to partake in my art. :)</li>
</ul>
