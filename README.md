 <h2> What am I looking at?
</h2>
<p>
Enigma was developed by myself (<a href="https://github.com/jnzj95">Jack Ng</a>) together with a friend (<a href="https://github.com/Ivan-LZY">Ivan Lim</a>), for a dance piece that I choreographed. The objective for developing this software was to have accompanying visual effects to highlight/obscure certain elements of the dancers' movements, and to offer the audience the option of looking at the same movement from a different perspective.
